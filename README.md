<h1>     HiveMind is a fake business website </h1>
<p> This started because of FBLA 2023 Wed Design Prompt to: Develop a website for a local business.<br> It could have been real or fake, so i came up witha  fake one.</p>
<br>
<p> I have a version of this already, it is on @AJJack0815 's profile, as that is my old profile that i got locked out of.</p>
<p> Since creating that website, i have gained a lot of knowledge, and i am going to apply that knowledge here, and keep updating the site here. </p>

<ul> 
Currently i am using:
  <li> React.js</li>
  <li> Bootstrap </li>
</ul>
